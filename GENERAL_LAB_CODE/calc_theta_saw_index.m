% function [stInd, thetaFreq] = calc_theta_saw_index(phiStartTms)
%
% PURPOSE: 
%  To calculate an index of "sawtoothiness" which is the log transformed ratio of the 
%  falling phase frequency over the rising phase frequency
%  NOTE: This is similar to Belluscio et al's asymmetry index, but that asymmetry index
%        is based on the DURATION of falling+trough/peak+rising, whereas this metric is
%        based on INSTANTANEOUS FREQUENCY (which is derived from duration and slope), and
%        this method only looks at falling and rising (i.e., excludes peak and trough)
%
% INPUT: 
%  phiStartTms = the start times for each phase (PK, FALL, TR, RISE) of each theta cycle
%                4 x n, where n is # of theta cycles
%
% OUTPUT: 
%      stInd = the sawtooth index for each theta cycle 
%  thetaFreq = the estimated frequency for both the rising and falling phases of each theta cycle
%              n x 2
