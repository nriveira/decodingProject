% function phaseTimes = get_theta_phase_times(lfpStruct, flipLfp)
%
% PURPOSE:
%   Go get the center times for each theta phase using the asymmetric theta
%   method described in Belluscio et al., 2012
%
% INPUT:
%       lfpStruct = lfp structure outputted by read_in_lfp with additional fields...
%                 narrowThetaLfp: time series for narrowly filtered theta EEG (e.g., 6-12 Hz)
%                  broadThetaLfp: time series for wide filtered theta EEG (e.g., 2-20 Hz)
%         flipLfp = optional binary input indicating whether or not to flip the LFP
%                   - Joe Manns's recording system produced LFPs that were upside down.
%                   - Default to 0 (no flip) if left out.
%
% OUTPUT:
%    phaseTimes = 4 x n matrix of the phase center times for each theta phase,
%                 (1,:) = peak
%                 (2,:) = falling
%                 (3,:) = trough
%                 (4,:) = rising
