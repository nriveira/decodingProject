% function evInds = find_lfp_events_in_power_ts(powerTs, eegSf, pkThresh, edgeThresh, minDur)
%
% PURPOSE: 
%  To get the edge indices for oscillatory events that meet the criteria specified. 
%  Operates on inputted power time-series, rather than filtered LFP.
%
% INPUT: 
%      powerTs = wavelet or MTFFT power time-series
%        eegSf = eeg sampling frequency (in Hz)
%     pkThresh = event peak detection threshold in standard deviations (suggestion: 2)
%   edgeThresh = event edge detection threshold in standard deviations (suggestion: 1)
%       minDur = minimum duration for an event in seconds; suggestion = 3 x average cycle length
%                 For Slow Gamma (25 - 50 Hz)
%                          Average frequency = 40 Hz
%                     Average cycle duration = 25 ms
%                       Three cycle duration = 75 ms 
%                           suggested minDur = 0.075
%
%                 For Fast Gamma (65 - 100 Hz)
%                          Average frequency = 80 Hz
%                     Average cycle duration = 12.5 ms
%                       Three cycle duration = 37.5 ms 
%                           suggested minDur = 0.0375

% OUTPUT: 
%      evInds = n x 2 matrix containing the indices for the edges of each event detected
%               evInds(:,1) = start indices
%               evInds(:,2) = peak indices (*max value of the amp envelope, not the filtered LFP*)
%               evInds(:,3) = end indices
